Compartment calling requires 'idat' files that can be downloaded from the TCGA legacy archive https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/legacy-archive
The following link should automatically set the correct filters to allow downloading the full set of required files: https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/legacy-archive/search/f?filters={%22op%22:%22and%22,%22content%22:[{%22op%22:%22in%22,%22content%22:{%22field%22:%22cases.project.project_id%22,%22value%22:[%22TCGA-PRAD%22]}},{%22op%22:%22in%22,%22content%22:{%22field%22:%22files.data_category%22,%22value%22:[%22Raw%20microarray%20data%22]}},{%22op%22:%22in%22,%22content%22:{%22field%22:%22files.data_format%22,%22value%22:[%22idat%22]}}]}

We have included a list of the tumour sample IDs (PRAD_Tumour_MethFilenames.txt) and normal sample IDs (PRAD_Normal_MethFilenames.txt) that are used in the accompanying script to select the appropriate idat files for processing.

Alternatively, you can load precomputed compartment call objects into R, which we have included as 'PRADcompartmentsT.rda' and 'PRADcompartmentsN.rda'.

LNCaP DNase-seq requires file 'ENCFF752YDY.bigWig' that can be downloaded by clicking the link (select hg19 processed data) at https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR000EPF/

Copy-number profiles from TCGA samples can be downloaded as gene-level thresholded Gistic2 value from the UCSC Xena browser with the following link: https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?dataset=TCGA.PRAD.sampleMap/Gistic2_CopyNumber_Gistic2_all_thresholded.by_genes&host=https://tcga.xenahubs.net

Pathway enrichment testing requires table of Biological pathways (as defined by source databases) with their genes identified with gene symbol accession numbers, downloadable from http://cpdb.molgen.mpg.de/

Transcription factor enrichment to aberrantly-compartmentalized regions requires ENCODE ChIP-seq narrowPeak bed files (hg19). These can be downloaded from https://www.encodeproject.org/matrix/?type=Experiment&replicates.library.biosample.donor.organism.scientific_name=Homo+sapiens&assembly=hg19&award.project=ENCODE&assay_title=ChIP-seq&target.investigated_as=transcription+factor&files.file_type=bed+narrowPeak

We have included a list of the bed files used in this study, 'ENCODE_TFpeakCounts.txt'

AR ChIPseq peak bed files are obtained from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE65478
